# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# generated rubocop file
.rubocop-https*

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# dev configs
/config/*-dev.yml
# Local Bonfire (Clowder deploy) settings
